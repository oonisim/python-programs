HIGH: PositionwiseFeedForward — unguarded self.W1.bias access (common.py:778)
  torch.nn.init.zeros_(self.W1.bias)
  If bias=False is passed, W1.bias is None and this crashes with AttributeError. Currently safe because both Encoder and Decoder pass bias=True (model.py:156, 216), so this never triggers in practice. But
  it's a latent bug — anyone calling PositionwiseFeedForward(bias=False) will crash.

  MEDIUM: Missing --weight_decay and --gradient_clip CLI args
  Both train_lm.py and train_translation.py lack CLI flags for these. TrainingConfig has weight_decay=0.1 and gradient_clip=1.0 as defaults, and they're used in optimizer/trainer creation, but users can't
  tune them from the command line.

  LOW: Extra space in error message (model.py:579)
  raise ValueError(msg )  # trailing space before )

[P2] top_k still lacks an upper‑bound check (> vocab_size) and can crash torch.topk. File: lm.py lines 433–438.
