HIGH: PositionwiseFeedForward — unguarded self.W1.bias access (common.py:778)
  torch.nn.init.zeros_(self.W1.bias)
  If bias=False is passed, W1.bias is None and this crashes with AttributeError. Currently safe because both Encoder and Decoder pass bias=True (model.py:156, 216), so this never triggers in practice. But
  it's a latent bug — anyone calling PositionwiseFeedForward(bias=False) will crash.

[P2] Attention has no padding mask support; padded tokens will be attended to in variable‑length batches. File: common.py lines 399–519.
[P2] top_k still lacks an upper‑bound check (> vocab_size) and can crash torch.topk. File: lm.py lines 433–438.
[P2] _train_one_epoch can divide by zero or error when len(train_loader) is 0 or undefined. File: trainer.py lines 276–300.
