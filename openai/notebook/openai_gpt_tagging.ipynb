    "\n",
    "Its use of an article in the constitution allowing such a move also gave the opposition the right to call motions of no confidence in the government and two such demands were filed.\n",

    "Pension reform has been imposed in France without a vote. How did it happen?\n",

    "The 577-seat National Assembly lower rejected a motion brought by the centrist LIOT coalition that is also supported by the left, by a margin of just nine votes, much narrower than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then overwhelmingly rejected a motion brought by the far-right National Rally (RN) with just 94 votes in favour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rejection of the motions means that the reform to raise the pensions age from 62 to 64 has now been adopted by the legislature. It still needs to be signed into law by Mr Macron and may also face legal challenges.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"We never went so far in building a compromise as we did with this reform,\" Ms Borne told parliament ahead of the vote, saying her use of the article to bypass a vote was \"profoundly democratic\" under France's constitution set up by postwar leader Charles de Gaulle.\n",

    "France wants to raise its retirement age by two years. Why are thousands protesting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, it remains unclear when Mr Macron will finally make public comments over the events, amid reports he is considering an address to the nation.\n",

    "Mr Macron has argued that the pension changes are needed to avoid crippling deficits in the coming decades linked to France's ageing population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Those among us who are able will gradually need to work more to finance our social model, which is one of the most generous in the world,\" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Sunday.\n",

    "As for Mr Macron's options now, replacing Ms Borne would be \"the least risky and the most likely to give him new momentum,\" Bruno Cautres of the Centre for Political Research told AFP.\n",

One of my favorite things about living here is that it's easy to get close to nature whether you're in a residential area or in the middle of the city, Melissa said. Originally a teacher, 12 years ago, she switched from the beaches of Sydney to the dark winters and cold lakes of Finland, and has never looked back since. Melissa said, For Finns, the concept of happiness is very different from the Australian concept of happiness. Finns, she said, are happy to accept portrayals of themselves as melancholy and stubborn — a popular local saying is, People who have happiness must hide it. The first thing I noticed here is that you don't go to dinners or barbecues, and you don't talk about real estate. No one asks you where you live, what suburb do you live in, where your kids go to school. The Finns seem quite happy with the status quo, and they don't always seem to want more. Melissa Georgio's Dark Night in Northern Europe Finland was named the happiest country in the world for the sixth year in a row in the World Happiness Report released by the United Nations. The Nordic countries are often countries with (good) unemployment benefits, pensions, and other benefits, explains happiness expert and researcher Frank Martela (Frank Martela). However, Frank said that Finland's position in the rankings often surprised its own people. Finns, they're almost outraged because they don't think this can be true. We listen to sad music and hard rock. Therefore, happiness is not part of the Finnish self-image. The other side of Finnish melancholy is a cultural focus on perseverance. Frank said it redefines the way Finns view happiness — a concept known as sisu — which is part of Finnish culture and is hard to translate directly, but can be understood as will, determination, perseverance, and reason to face adversity. This, he said, is best reflected in Finns' favorite pastime — getting warm in a sauna after taking a bath in freezing temperatures. It's about this paradox — from one extreme to the other, and it's a pretty fun experience... because you need perseverance. Melissa said, but Finland has many things that are great and can provide happiness for people in this country. Finland is one of the European countries least affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and experts attribute this to a high level of trust in the government and little resistance to complying with restrictions. Trust in government, on the other hand, stems from a country's investment in its citizens. The public school system rarely tests children and is one of the best in the world. Finland also has a universal health care system with affordable childcare and strong support for parents. Melissa said, The whole country is taking care of the child's development. This system is very well set up. So from having my son to raising him at home, to sending him to daycare, to going to school, I was very well supported in every aspect of this. Finland vs. China, which country has the strongest sense of happiness? Since the publication of the World Happiness Report, the Nordic countries have dominated the top ten. In this year's report, Finland and its neighbors Denmark (2nd), Iceland (3rd), Sweden (6th), and Norway (7th) all scored high on happiness indicators, including healthy life expectancy, per capita GDP, low levels of corruption, social support, freedom, trust, and generosity. Other top ten countries/regions include the Netherlands (5th), Switzerland (8th), Luxembourg (9th), and New Zealand (10th). Australia ranked 12th in this report, followed by Canada (13th), Ireland (14th), and the United States (15th). In Asia, Singapore ranked 25th in the world, up two places from last year, Taiwan dropped one place from last year to 27th, Japan rose to 47th, mainland China ranked 64th, and Hong Kong ranked 82nd. Meanwhile, the polling agency Ipsos Group (Ipsos) released a survey report on the global happiness index. The results showed that out of 32 countries, the country with the highest happiness index was China (91%), followed by Saudi Arabia (86%), the Netherlands (85%), India (84%), and Brazil (83%). Australia ranked 9th in this report. According to the survey report, on average, happiness increased more significantly in middle-income countries (as defined by the World Bank) than in high-income countries.\""

    "澳大利亚人梅丽莎·乔治奥（Melissa Georgiou）十多年前移居芬兰，在地球上最寒冷、最黑暗的地方之一寻求幸福。\n",
    "\n",
    "梅丽莎说：“在这里生活，我最喜欢的事情之一是，无论你是在住宅区还是在城市中间，都很容易接近大自然。”\n",
    "她原本是一名教师，12年前，她从悉尼的海滩换到了芬兰的黑暗冬天和冰冷湖泊，此后再也没有回头。\n",
    "梅丽莎说：“对芬兰人来说，幸福的概念与澳大利亚人的幸福概念非常不同。\n",
    "\n",
    "她说，芬兰人乐于接受将自己描绘成忧郁、矜持的形象——当地流行的一句话是：“拥有幸福的人必须把它隐藏起来。”\n",
    "\n",
    "“在这里，我注意到的第一件事是，你不会去参加晚宴或烧烤，也不会谈论房地产。没有人问你住在哪里，住在哪个郊区，你的孩子在哪里上学。” \n",
    "芬兰人似乎对现状相当满意，他们似乎并不总是想要更多。\n",

    "北欧的黑夜\n",
    "在联合国最新发布的《世界幸福报告》中，芬兰连续第六年被评为世界上最幸福的国家。\n",
    "\n",
    "幸福专家和研究员弗兰克·马特拉（Frank Martela）解释说：“北欧国家往往是有（良好）失业救济、养老金和其他福利的国家。”\n",
    "但弗兰克说，芬兰在排名中的位置往往让其本国人民感到惊讶。\n",
    "\n",
    "“芬兰人，他们几乎感到愤怒，因为他们觉得这不可能是真的。我们听的是悲伤的音乐，还有硬摇滚。”\n",
    "“因此，幸福并不是芬兰人自我形象的一部分。”\n",
    "\n",
    "芬兰人忧郁的另一面是对毅力的文化关注，弗兰克说这重新定义了芬兰人看待幸福的方式——一个被称为“sisu”的概念——这是芬兰文化的一部分，很难直译，但可理解为意志、决心、毅力和理性面对逆境。\n",
    "\n",
    "他说，这在芬兰人最喜欢的消遣方式中得到了最好的体现——在冰点以下的气温中泡完海澡后，在桑拿房里取暖。\n",
    "\n",
    "“这是关于这种矛盾——从一个极端到另一个极端，而这是相当有趣的体验......因为你需要毅力。”\n",
    "\n",
    "梅丽莎说，但芬兰有很多东西是伟大的，可以为这个国家的人提供幸福。\n",
    "芬兰是受新冠大流行影响最小的欧洲国家之一，专家们将此归功于对政府的高度信任和对遵循限制措施的较小阻力。\n",
    "\n",
    "而对政府的信任则源于国家对其公民的投资。\n",
    "\n",
    "公立学校系统很少对儿童进行测试，是世界上最好的学校之一。芬兰也有一个全民医疗保健系统，有民众负担得起的儿童保育和对父母的有力支持。\n",
    "\n",
    "梅丽莎说：“整个国家都在照顾孩子的成长，这个制度设置得非常好。因此，从生下我儿子到在家抚养他，再到送他去日托，再到上学，这一切的每个方面都得到了很好的支持。”\n",
    "芬兰VS中国 幸福感哪国最强？\n",
    "自《世界幸福报告》发布以来，北欧国家一直在前十名中占主导地位。在今年的报告中，芬兰及其邻国丹麦（第2名）、冰岛（第3名）、瑞典（第6名）和挪威（第7名）在幸福指标中的得分都很高，包括健康的预期寿命、人均GDP、低腐败程度、社会支持、自由、信任与慷慨等。\n",
    "\n",
    "其他位列前十的国家/地区包括，荷兰（第5名）、瑞士（第8名）、卢森堡（第9名）及新西兰（第10名）。\n",
    "\n",
    "澳大利亚在这份报告中排名第12名，紧随其后的是加拿大（第13名）、爱尔兰（第14名）、美国（第15名）。\n",
    "\n",
    "亚洲地区，新加坡排全球第25名，较去年上升两位，台湾较去年下跌一位到第27名，日本排名升至第47名，中国大陆排第64名，香港排名第82名。\n",
    "\n",
    " 与此同时，民调机构益普索集团（Ipsos）业发布了一份有关全球幸福指数的调查报告，结果显示，在32个国家中，幸福感指数最高的国家是中国（91%），其后是沙特阿拉伯（86%）、荷兰（85%）、印度（84%）、巴西（83%）。\n",
    "\n",
    "澳大利亚在这份报告中位列第9名。\n",

       "'在 SBS On Demand 可免费收看《世界上最幸福的国度》（The World s Happiest Country）。 澳大利亚人梅丽莎·乔治奥（Melissa Georgiou）十多年前移居芬兰，在地球上最寒冷、最黑暗的地方之一寻求幸福。 梅丽莎说：“在这里生活，我最喜欢的事情之一是，无论你是在住宅区还是在城市中间，都很容易接近大自然。” 她原本是一名教师，12年前，她从悉尼的海滩换到了芬兰的黑暗冬天和冰冷湖泊，此后再也没有回头。 梅丽莎说：“对芬兰人来说，幸福的概念与澳大利亚人的幸福概念非常不同。 她说，芬兰人乐于接受将自己描绘成忧郁、矜持的形象——当地流行的一句话是：“拥有幸福的人必须把它隐藏起来。” “在这里，我注意到的第一件事是，你不会去参加晚宴或烧烤，也不会谈论房地产。没有人问你住在哪里，住在哪个郊区，你的孩子在哪里上学。” 芬兰人似乎对现状相当满意，他们似乎并不总是想要更多。 梅丽莎·乔治奥 北欧的黑夜 在联合国最新发布的《世界幸福报告》中，芬兰连续第六年被评为世界上最幸福的国家。 幸福专家和研究员弗兰克·马特拉（Frank Martela）解释说：“北欧国家往往是有（良好）失业救济、养老金和其他福利的国家。” 但弗兰克说，芬兰在排名中的位置往往让其本国人民感到惊讶。 “芬兰人，他们几乎感到愤怒，因为他们觉得这不可能是真的。我们听的是悲伤的音乐，还有硬摇滚。” “因此，幸福并不是芬兰人自我形象的一部分。” 芬兰人忧郁的另一面是对毅力的文化关注，弗兰克说这重新定义了芬兰人看待幸福的方式——一个被称为“sisu”的概念——这是芬兰文化的一部分，很难直译，但可理解为意志、决心、毅力和理性面对逆境。 他说，这在芬兰人最喜欢的消遣方式中得到了最好的体现——在冰点以下的气温中泡完海澡后，在桑拿房里取暖。 “这是关于这种矛盾——从一个极端到另一个极端，而这是相当有趣的体验......因为你需要毅力。” 梅丽莎说，但芬兰有很多东西是伟大的，可以为这个国家的人提供幸福。 芬兰是受新冠大流行影响最小的欧洲国家之一，专家们将此归功于对政府的高度信任和对遵循限制措施的较小阻力。 而对政府的信任则源于国家对其公民的投资。 公立学校系统很少对儿童进行测试，是世界上最好的学校之一。芬兰也有一个全民医疗保健系统，有民众负担得起的儿童保育和对父母的有力支持。 梅丽莎说：“整个国家都在照顾孩子的成长，这个制度设置得非常好。因此，从生下我儿子到在家抚养他，再到送他去日托，再到上学，这一切的每个方面都得到了很好的支持。” 芬兰VS中国 幸福感哪国最强？ 自《世界幸福报告》发布以来，北欧国家一直在前十名中占主导地位。在今年的报告中，芬兰及其邻国丹麦（第2名）、冰岛（第3名）、瑞典（第6名）和挪威（第7名）在幸福指标中的得分都很高，包括健康的预期寿命、人均GDP、低腐败程度、社会支持、自由、信任与慷慨等。 其他位列前十的国家/地区包括，荷兰（第5名）、瑞士（第8名）、卢森堡（第9名）及新西兰（第10名）。 澳大利亚在这份报告中排名第12名，紧随其后的是加拿大（第13名）、爱尔兰（第14名）、美国（第15名）。 亚洲地区，新加坡排全球第25名，较去年上升两位，台湾较去年下跌一位到第27名，日本排名升至第47名，中国大陆排第64名，香港排名第82名。 与此同时，民调机构益普索集团（Ipsos）业发布了一份有关全球幸福指数的调查报告，结果显示，在32个国家中，幸福感指数最高的国家是中国（91%），其后是沙特阿拉伯（86%）、荷兰（85%）、印度（84%）、巴西（83%）。 澳大利亚在这份报告中位列第9名。 调查报告指出，平均而言，中等收入国家（按照世界银行定义）的幸福感，比高收入国家的幸福感增长得更明显。'"
