It was about as popular as a root canal.\\n\\nBut when I ran for president, I promised I wouldn't just do what was popular -- I would do what was necessary. And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. More businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would have surely been lost.\",\n",

At the beginning of the last decade, America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion. By the time I took office, we had a one year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts and an expensive prescription drug program. On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget. That was before I walked in the door.\\n\\nNow if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit.

       " \"more homes would have surely been lost. so i supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program. and when we took the program over, we made it more transparent and accountable. as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we have recovered most of the money we spent on the banks. to recover the rest, i have proposed a fee on the biggest banks. i know wall street isn't keen on this idea, but if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need. as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible and help americans who had become unemployed. that's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million americans, made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through cobra and passed 25 different tax cuts. let me repeat : we cut taxes. we cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. we cut taxes for small businesses. we cut taxes for first - time homebuyers. we cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. we cut taxes for 8 million americans paying for college. as a\",\n",
       " \"result, millions of americans had more to spend on gas, and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. and we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person. not a single dime. because of the steps we took, there are about 2 million americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed - - 200, 000 work in construction and clean energy, 300, 000 are teachers and other education workers, tens of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers and first responders. and we are on track to add another one - and - a - half - million jobs to this total by the end of the year. the plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the recovery act. that's right - - the recovery act, also known as the stimulus bill. economists on the left and the right say that this bill has helped saved jobs and avert disaster. but you don't have to take their word for it. talk to the small business in phoenix that will triple its work force because of the recovery act. talk to the window manufacturer in philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the recovery act, until he had to add two more work\",\n",
       " \"shifts just because of the business it created. talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the recovery act, she wouldn't be laid off after all. there are stories like this all across america. and after two years of recession, the economy is growing again. retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value. businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly some are starting to hire again. but i realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from - - who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response. that is why jobs must be our number one focus in 2010, and that is why i am calling for a new jobs bill tonight. now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be america's businesses. but government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers. we should start where most new jobs do - - in small businesses, companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides it's time she became her own boss. through sheer grit and determination,\",\n",
       " \"these companies have weathered the recession and are ready to grow. but when you talk to small business owners in places like allentown, pa., or elyria, ohio, you find out that even though banks on wall street are lending again, they are mostly lending to bigger companies. but financing remains difficult for small business owners across the country. so tonight, i'm proposing that we take $ 30 billion of the money wall street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat. i am also proposing a new small business tax credit - - one that will go to over 1 million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages. while we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment and provide a tax incentive for all businesses, large and small, to invest in new plants and equipment. next, we can put americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow. from the first railroads to the interstate highway system, our nation has always been built to compete. there's no reason europe or china should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products. tomorrow, i'll visit tampa, fla., where workers will soon break ground\",\n",
       " \"on a new high - speed railroad funded by the recovery act. there are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help our nation move goods, services and information. we should put more americans to work building clean energy facilities and give rebates to americans who make their homes more energy efficient, which supports clean energy jobs. and to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it's time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs in the united states of america. the house has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps. as the first order of business this year, i urge the senate to do the same. people are out of work. they are hurting. they need our help. and i want a jobs bill on my desk without delay. but the truth is, these steps still won't make up for the 7 million jobs we've lost over the last two years. the only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long - term economic growth and finally address the problems that america's families have confronted for years. we cannot afford another so - called economic expansion like the one from last decade - - what\",\n",
       " \"some call the lost decade - - where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion, where the income of the average american household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs, where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation. from the day i took office, i have been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious - - that such efforts would be too contentious, that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while. for those who make these claims, i have one simple question : how long should we wait? how long should america put its future on hold? you see, washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse. meanwhile, china's not waiting to revamp its economy ; germany's not waiting ; india's not waiting. these nations aren't standing still. these nations aren't playing for second place. they're putting more emphasis on math and science. they're rebuilding their infrastructure. they are making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs. well i do not accept second place for the united states of america. as hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may\",\n",
       " \"be, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth. one place to start is serious financial reform. look, i am not interested in punishing banks, i'm interested in protecting our economy. a strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. it channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes. but that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy. we need to make sure consumers and middle class families have the information they need to make financial decisions. we can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy. the house has already passed financial reform with many of these changes. and the lobbyists are already trying to kill it. well, we cannot let them win this fight. and if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, i will send it back. next, we need to encourage american innovation. last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history - - an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched.\",\n",
       " \"and no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy. you can see the results of last year's investment in clean energy - - in the north carolina company that will create 1, 200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries, or in the california business that will put 1, 000 people to work making solar panels. but to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives. that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country. it means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development. it means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies. and yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in america. i am grateful to the house for passing such a bill last year. this year, i am eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the senate. i know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy, and i know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. but even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future - - because\",\n",
       " \"the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy. and america must be that nation. third, we need to export more of our goods. because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in america. so tonight, we set a new goal : we will double our exports over the next five years, an increase that will support 2 million jobs in america. to help meet this goal, we're launching a national export initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security. we have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are. if america sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores. but realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules. and that's why we will continue to shape a doha trade agreement that opens global markets, and why we will strengthen our trade relations in asia and with key partners like south korea, panama and colombia. fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people. this year, we have broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to\",\n",
       " \"improve our schools. the idea here is simple : instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform - - reform that raises student achievement, inspires students to excel in math and science, and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young americans, from rural communities to inner cities. in the 21st century, one of the best anti - poverty programs is a world - class education. in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than their potential. when we renew the elementary and secondary education act, we will work with congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states. still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job. i urge the senate to follow the house and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families. to make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans. instead, let's take that money and give families a $ 10, 000 tax credit for four years of college and increase pell grants. and let's tell another 1 million students that when they\",\n",

       " \"homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages. and it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle - class families that we still need health insurance reform. now let's be clear - - i did not choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt. and by now it should be fairly obvious that i didn't take on health care because it was good politics. i took on health care because of the stories i've heard from americans with pre - existing conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage, patients who've been denied coverage and families - - even those with insurance - - who are just one illness away from financial ruin. after nearly a century of trying, we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many americans. the approach we've taken would protect every american from the worst practices of the insurance industry. it would give small businesses and uninsured americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market. it would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care. and by the way, i want to acknowledge our first lady, michelle obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make our kids healthier. our approach would preserve the\",\n",

       " \"who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo. but if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen medicare for seniors and stop insurance company abuses, let me know. here's what i ask of congress, though : do not walk away from reform. not now. not when we are so close. let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the american people. now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. it's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve, and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing. so let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight. at the beginning of the last decade, america had a budget surplus of over $ 200 billion. by the time i took office, we had a one year deficit of over $ 1 trillion and projected deficits of $ 8 trillion over the next decade. most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts and an expensive prescription drug program. on top of\",\n",
       " \"that, the effects of the recession put a $ 3 trillion hole in our budget. that was before i walked in the door. now if we had taken office in ordinary times, i would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit. but we took office amid a crisis, and our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $ 1 trillion to our national debt. i am absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do. but families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. the federal government should do the same. so tonight, i'm proposing specific steps to pay for the $ 1 trillion that it took to rescue the economy last year. starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years. spending related to our national security, medicare, medicaid and social security will not be affected. but all other discretionary government programs will. like any cash - strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't. and if i have to enforce this discipline by veto, i will. we will continue to go through the budget line by line to eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work. we've already identified $ 20 billion\",\n",
       " \"in savings for next year. to help working families, we will extend our middle - class tax cuts. but at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, investment fund managers and those making over $ 250, 000 a year. we just can't afford it. now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we will still face the massive deficit we had when i took office. more importantly, the cost of medicare, medicaid and social security will continue to skyrocket. that's why i've called for a bipartisan fiscal commission, modeled on a proposal by republican judd gregg and democrat kent conrad. this can't be one of those washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solved a problem. the commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline. yesterday, the senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission. so i will issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because i refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of americans. and when the vote comes tomorrow, the senate should restore the pay - as - you - go law that was a big reason why we had record surpluses in the 1990s. i know\",\n",
       " \"that some in my own party will argue that we cannot address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting. i agree, which is why this freeze will not take effect until next year, when the economy is stronger. but understand - - if we do not take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing and jeopardize our recovery - - all of which could have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes. from some on the right, i expect we'll hear a different argument - - that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts for wealthier americans, eliminate more regulations and maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away. the problem is, that's what we did for eight years. that's what helped lead us into this crisis. it's what helped lead to these deficits. and we cannot do it again. rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated washington for decades, it's time to try something new. let's invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt. let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here. let's try common\",\n",
       " \"sense. to do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now. we face a deficit of trust - - deep and corrosive doubts about how washington works that have been growing for years. to close that credibility gap we must take action on both ends of pennsylvania avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists ; to do our work openly and to give our people the government they deserve. that's what i came to washington to do. that's why - - for the first time in history - - my administration posts our white house visitors online. and that's why we've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs or seats on federal boards and commissions. but we can't stop there. it's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or congress. and it's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office. last week, the supreme court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests - - including foreign corporations - - to spend without limit in our elections. well, i don't think american elections should be bankrolled by america's most powerful interests,\",\n",
       " \"or worse, by foreign entities. they should be decided by the american people, and that's why i'm urging democrats and republicans to pass a bill that helps to right this wrong. i'm also calling on congress to continue down the path of earmark reform. you have trimmed some of this spending and embraced some meaningful change. but restoring the public trust demands more. for example, some members of congress post some earmark requests online. tonight, i'm calling on congress to publish all earmark requests on a single web site before there's a vote, so that the american people can see how their money is being spent. of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how we work with one another. now, i am not naive. i never thought the mere fact of my election would usher in peace, harmony and some post - partisan era. i knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched. and on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. these disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, have been taking place for over 200 years. they are the very essence of our democracy\",\n",
       " \". but what frustrates the american people is a washington where every day is election day. we cannot wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about their opponent - - a belief that if you lose, i win. neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can. the confirmation of well - qualified public servants should not be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual senators. washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, is just part of the game. but it is precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the american people. worse yet, it is sowing further division among our citizens and further distrust in our government. so no, i will not give up on changing the tone of our politics. i know it's an election year. and after last week, it is clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual. but we still need to govern. to democrats, i would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people expect us to solve some problems, not run for the hills. and if the republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the senate are\",\n",

There are multiple index types as in [Faiss indexes](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/Faiss-indexes). Faiss index itself is the vector database that manages the vectors and provide add(vector) and search(vector) interfaces. Named as Index is because it provides indexing feature for fast similarity search. FAISS Index does not offer other metadata or interfaces such as primary key to uniquely identify and retrieve the vectors, but focus only to provide similarity search. Hence LangChain provides additional metadata management using its [InMemoryDocstore](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/stores_doc_in_memory.InMemoryDocstore.html).\n",

This type of index doesn’t compress or cluster your vectors. Nevertheless, it has some features which might worsen your experience. You have to remember that **FAISS uses the formula which can cause catastrophic cancellation** when floats of different magnitudes are added. We can also avoid it by using double-precision floating-point format (float64). However, we should remember that **FAISS works only with float32** format.\n",
