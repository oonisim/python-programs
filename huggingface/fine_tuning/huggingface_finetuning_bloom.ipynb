    "User: Number BLOOM is an autoregressive Large Language Model (LLM), trained to continue text from a prompt on vast amounts of text data using industrial-scale computational resources. As such, it is able to output coherent text in 46 languages and 13 programming languages that is hardly distinguishable from text written by humans. BLOOM can also be instructed to perform text tasks it hasn't been explicitly trained for, by casting them as text generation tasks.\n",

The federal government said the actions, announced in late December, would mean that by the summer of 2030 the federal deficit would be as low as $5.8 trillion dollars. The reduction in health care costs, from $500 billion to $450 billion, means that there will be just 2.5 million more people in the United States eligible for some form of private healthcare. And energy companies will be able to spend more. The federal government says that, from a carbon footprint perspective, it has increased the United States carbon footprint by 29% since 1990.
