Machine learning is an increasingly important area at Bloomberg, a company that manages massive amounts of data in a real-time environment. While machine learning is generally about giving computers the ability to learn by using algorithms to analyze data, find patterns or predict outcomes, much of Bloomberg’s efforts today in this area are focused on helping the company’s customers to pluck intelligence and insight from the financial information and data coursing through its network that feeds the Bloomberg Terminal. Fresh off of his presentations at two key industry events, Gary explains what he and his team are doing and how that is helping investors and Bloomberg customers make better, more informed decisions.\n",
