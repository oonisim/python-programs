# Chapter 5: Visualizing Data with Pandas and Matplotlib

This chapter shows you how to create your own data visualizations in Python, first using the `matplotlib` library, and then directly from `pandas` objects.

## Content

There are three notebooks that we will work through, each numbered according to when they will be used:

- [`1-introducing_matplotlib.ipynb`](./1-introducing_matplotlib.ipynb): introduces you to plotting with `matplotlib`
- [`2-plotting_with_pandas.ipynb`](./2-plotting_with_pandas.ipynb): covers plotting with `pandas`
- [`3-pandas_plotting_module.ipynb`](./3-pandas_plotting_module.ipynb): provides some exposure to additional plot types available in `pandas.plotting`

All the datasets necessary for the aforementioned notebooks, along with information on them, can be found in the [`data/`](./data) directory. The end-of-chapter exercises will use these datasets as well; solutions to the exercises can be found in the repository's [`solutions/ch_05/`](../solutions/ch_05) directory.
