# Chapter 11 Solutions

The end-of-chapter exercises focused on further practice with the machine learning workflow and exposure to some additional anomaly detection strategies. Each exercise has a corresponding solution notebook:

- [`exercise_1.ipynb`](./exercise_1.ipynb): unsupervised anomaly detection with a one-class SVM
- [`exercise_2.ipynb`](./exercise_2.ipynb): finding outliers with k-means
- [`exercise_3.ipynb`](./exercise_3.ipynb): supervised anomaly detection with a random forest
- [`exercise_4.ipynb`](./exercise_4.ipynb): using `partial_fit()` with grid search
