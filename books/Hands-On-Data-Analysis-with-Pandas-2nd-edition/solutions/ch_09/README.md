# Chapter 9 Solutions

The end-of-chapter exercises focused on building machine learning models with `scikit-learn`. Each exercise has a corresponding solution notebook:

- [`exercise_1.ipynb`](./exercise_1.ipynb): clustering by wine color
- [`exercise_2.ipynb`](./exercise_2.ipynb): predicting star temperature
- [`exercise_3.ipynb`](./exercise_3.ipynb): predicting whether a planet has a shorter year than Earth
- [`exercise_4.ipynb`](./exercise_4.ipynb): multiclass classification of white wine quality
- [`exercise_5.ipynb`](./exercise_5.ipynb): predicting red wine quality with a support vector machine
