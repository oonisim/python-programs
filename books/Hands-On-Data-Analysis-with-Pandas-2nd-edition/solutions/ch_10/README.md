# Chapter 10 Solutions

The end-of-chapter exercises focused on building and tuning machine learning models with `scikit-learn`. Each exercise has a corresponding solution notebook:

- [`exercise_1.ipynb`](./exercise_1.ipynb): predicting star temperature with elastic net regression
- [`exercise_2.ipynb`](./exercise_2.ipynb): multiclass classification of white wine quality with a support vector machine and feature union
- [`exercise_3.ipynb`](./exercise_3.ipynb): multiclass classification of white wine quality with over-sampling and k-NN
- [`exercise_4.ipynb`](./exercise_4.ipynb): testing if wine type helps predict wine quality
- [`exercise_5.ipynb`](./exercise_5.ipynb): multiclass voting classifier to predict wine quality score
