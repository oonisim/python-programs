# Chapter 9: Getting Started with Machine Learning in Python

This chapter introduces you to machine learning and building models using the `sklearn` library.

## Content

We will be working in the following notebooks:

- [`planets_ml.ipynb`](./planets_ml.ipynb): shows how to build clustering and linear regression models using the planet data
- [`preprocessing.ipynb`](./preprocessing.ipynb): walks through various preprocessing techniques
- [`red_wine.ipynb`](./red_wine.ipynb): discusses how to build a classification model to predict red wine quality
- [`wine.ipynb`](./wine.ipynb): walks through creating a classification model to predict wine type

*Note that the [`planets_data_collection.ipynb`](./planets_data_collection.ipynb) notebook contains the code used to collect the planet data.*

All the datasets necessary for the aforementioned notebooks, along with information on them, can be found in the [`data/`](./data) directory. The end-of-chapter exercises will also use this data to practice building ML models with scikit-learn; solutions to these exercises can be found in the repository's [`solutions/ch_09/`](../solutions/ch_09) directory.
