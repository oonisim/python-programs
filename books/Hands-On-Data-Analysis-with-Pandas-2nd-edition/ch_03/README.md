# Chapter 3: Data Wrangling with Pandas

In this chapter, we discuss the process of data manipulation, learn how to explore an API to gather data, and perform data cleaning and reshaping with `pandas`.

## Content

There are five notebooks that we will work through, each numbered according to when they will be used:

- [`1-wide_vs_long.ipynb`](./1-wide_vs_long.ipynb): discusses wide versus long format data
- [`2-using_the_weather_api.ipynb`](./2-using_the_weather_api.ipynb): walks through collecting daily temperature data from the [NCEI API](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2)
- [`3-cleaning_data.ipynb`](./3-cleaning_data.ipynb): shows how to perform some initial data cleaning
- [`4-reshaping_data.ipynb`](./4-reshaping_data.ipynb): illustrates how to reshape data with `pandas`
- [`5-handling_data_issues.ipynb`](./5-handling_data_issues.ipynb): showcases strategies for dealing with duplicate, missing, or invalid data

All the datasets necessary for the aforementioned notebooks, along with information on them, can be found in the [`data/`](./data) directory. The end-of-chapter exercises will use the datasets in the [`exercises/`](./exercises) directory; solutions to these exercises can be found in the repository's [`solutions/ch_03/`](../solutions/ch_03) directory.
