# Chapter 2: Working with Pandas DataFrames

This chapter introduces you to the `pandas` library and shows you the basics of working with `DataFrame` objects.

## Content

There are six notebooks that we will work through, each numbered according to when they will be used:

- [`1-pandas_data_structures.ipynb`](./1-pandas_data_structures.ipynb): discusses the main `pandas` data structures and why we need them
- [`2-creating_dataframes.ipynb`](./2-creating_dataframes.ipynb): walks through creating `DataFrame` objects from a variety of data sources, such as flat files, SQL queries, and other Python objects
- [`3-making_dataframes_from_api_requests.ipynb`](./3-making_dataframes_from_api_requests.ipynb): shows how to collect data from an API and create a `DataFrame` object with the result, using the [USGS earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/)
- [`4-inspecting_dataframes.ipynb`](./4-inspecting_dataframes.ipynb): illustrates how perform an initial inspection of the data, including displaying the `DataFrame` object and summarizing the contents
- [`5-subsetting_data.ipynb`](./5-subsetting_data.ipynb): showcases strategies for subsetting the data by rows, columns, and/or Boolean criteria
- [`6-adding_and_removing_data.ipynb`](./6-adding_and_removing_data.ipynb): provides examples of adding additional rows/columns and removing rows/columns from a `DataFrame` object

All the datasets necessary for the aforementioned notebooks, along with information on them, can be found in the [`data/`](./data) directory. The end-of-chapter exercises will use these datasets as well; solutions to the exercises can be found in the repository's [`solutions/ch_02/`](../solutions/ch_02) directory.
