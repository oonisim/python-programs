# Chapter 1: Introduction to Data Analysis

This chapter will teach you the fundamentals of data analysis, give you a foundation in statistics, and get your environment set up for working with data in Python and using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Content

The first half of the chapter will be an overview of the data analysis and statistics concepts necessary to work through the book; feel free to follow along in the [`introduction_to_data_analysis.ipynb`](./introduction_to_data_analysis.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook.

Afterward, we will walk through setting up a virtual environment for working through the book. In order to validate the setup, we will use the [`checking_your_setup.ipynb`](./checking_your_setup.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook. Under the hood, this uses the [`check_environment.py`](./check_environment.py) module.

The end-of-chapter exercises will use the [`exercises.ipynb`](./exercises.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook; solutions to these exercises can be found in the repository's [`solutions/ch_01/`](../solutions/ch_01) directory.

*Tip: Use the [`python_101.ipynb`](./python_101.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook for a Python crash-course/refresher, if needed.*
