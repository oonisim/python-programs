    "> Have the function StockPicker(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr which will contain integers that represent the amount in dollars that a single stock is worth, and return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying stock on day x and selling stock on day y where y > x. For example: if arr is [44, 30, 24, 32, 35, 30, 40, 38, 15] then your program should return 16 because at index 2 the stock was worth $24 and at index 6 the stock was then worth $40, so if you bought the stock at 24 and sold it at 40, you would have made a profit of $16, which is the maximum profit that could have been made with this list of stock prices.\n",

    "> If there is not profit that could have been made with the stock prices, then your program should return -1. For example: arr is [10, 9, 8, 2] then your program should return -1."
