Hi Masa, Thanks for your response. The team would be open to waiting for you until Feb, I don't think it would be an issuie. Do you have a particular start date

Hi Tasha, apology. Please use the attached one. The previous one prints debugging outputs hence not output expected. Regards, Masa

Hi Masa, Thank you for this. I have passed it over to the team. I should be able to come back to you with feedback early next week. How is your project going so

Hi Tasha, thanks for the update. My project is making progress ... slowly. Wish I had a better brain. It is implementing a kind of ML. Regards, Masa

Hi Tasha, based on the feedback from you, I have reimplemented it with decomposition into classes and created unit testings. If still possible, please send the attached robot2.zip to your client.

The README in the zip explains the system requirements and how to run.

Regards,
Masa


FYI

I am implementing a deep neural network from its mathematics basics. Neural network is a combination of simple nodes such as a multiplication node.

But to get the simple formula took so much like below... so I am taking a few months to work on it. Hope it hints on my personal project.

Assignment
==========

Design and implement a solution for a Robot which can move on a board of size n x m.

Requirements
------------

1. Robot is always facing one of the following directions: NORTH, EAST,SOUTH or WEST.
2. Robot can turn left, right, and move one step at a time.
3. Robot cannot move off the board and ignores a command forcing it to do it.
4. Robot can report its current position on the board and direction.
5. A newly created robot must be placed into location x=0 y=0 and face NORTH.
6. The board is aligned with Cartesian coordinate system. Its bottom left corner has coordinate (0,0) and top right (n-1, m-1).

The solution will receive commands as a text file and outputs robot's reports into STDOUT. Below are the only commands that robot understands:

PLACE x y direction     -- places robot into specified location on a board and set initial direction
MOVE                    -- moves robot one step in the current direction
LEFT                    -- turns robot 90 degrees anticlockwise
RIGTH                   -- turns robot 90 degrees clockwise
REPORT                  -- outputs current state into STDOUT


For example, the following input file:
PLACE 0 0 NORTH
MOVE
REPORT
PLACE 0 0 NORTH
LEFT
REPORT
PLACE 1 2 EAST
MOVE
MOVE
LEFT
MOVE
REPORT

should produce an output similar to:
X: 0 Y: 1 Direction: NORTH
X: 0 Y: 0 Direction: WEST
X: 3 Y: 3 Direction: NORTH



Acceptance criteria
-------------------

1. Solution should correctly work for different command lists.
2. Quality of solution design and implementation should be of production grade and the following will be assessed:
    - Design and decomposition of the solution into packages, classes, functions, ...
    - Unit and/or integration tests
    - Solution readability and maintainability
