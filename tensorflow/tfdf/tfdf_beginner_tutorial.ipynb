    "Decision Forests (DF) are a large family of Machine Learning algorithms for\n",

    "algorithms are [Random Forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) and\n",
    "[Gradient Boosted Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting). Both algorithms are ensemble techniques that use multiple decision trees, but differ on how they do it.\n",
