    "TFDV can compute descriptive statistics that provide a quick overview of the data in terms of the features that are present and the shapes of their value distributions. Tools such as Facets Overview can provide a succinct visualization of these statistics for easy browsing.\n",

    "\n",
    "> This example colab notebook illustrates how TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV) can be used to investigate and visualize your dataset. That includes looking at descriptive statistics, inferring a schema, checking for and fixing anomalies, and checking for drift and skew in our dataset. It's important to understand your dataset's characteristics, including how it might change over time in your production pipeline. It's also important to look for anomalies in your data, and to compare your training, evaluation, and serving datasets to make sure that they're consistent.\n",

This notebook is based on the TFX pipeline we built in Simple TFX Pipeline Tutorial. If you have not read that tutorial yet, you should read it before proceeding with this notebook.\n",
