    ## Overview:
    ----
    Extensible Business Markup Language (XBRL) is an XML-based format for
    reporting financial statements used by the SEC and financial regulatory
    agencies across the world. XBRL, in a separate XML file or more recently
    embedded in quarterly and annual HTML reports as inline XBRL, was first
    required by the SEC in 2009. XBRL facts must be associated for a
    standard US-GAAP or IFRS taxonomy. Companies can also extend standard
    taxonomies with their own custom taxonomies.

        ### Overview:
        ----
        This API supports for annual, quarterly and instantaneous data. Where the units of measure
        specified in the XBRL contains a numerator and a denominator, these are separated by “-per-”
        such as “USD-per-shares”. Note that the default unit in XBRL is “pure”.

        The period format is CY#### for annual data (duration 365 days +/- 30 days), CY####Q# for
        quarterly data (duration 91 days +/- 30 days), and CY####Q#I for instantaneous data. Because
        company financial calendars can start and end on any month or day and even change in length
        from quarter to quarter to according to the day of the week, the frame data is assembled by
        the dates that best align with a calendar quarter or year. Data users should be mindful
        different reporting start and end dates for facts contained in a frame.

        ### Arguments:
        ----
        concept : Union[str, Enum]
            A taxonomy and tag you want to retrieve data for.

        unit_of_measure : Union[str, Enum]

            "USD" or "USD-per-shares".

        period. : Union[str, Enum]
            The period format, for example grabbing 2020 would look like
            CY2020. If I want Q1 of 2020 then it would look like CY2020Q1.
            Instantaneous data would look like CY2020Q1I.
