 first national bank of boston for example is offering certain new <unk> an extra quarter of a percentage point on six-month and 12-month cds
 some banks actually boosted yields on the <unk> term cds in the latest week

 cd yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks

 conservatives have an important decision to make this fall
 at the recent meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund the bush administration announced its intention to decide by <unk> the size of the next increase in the imf 's capital base
 while the u.s. share of the increase probably will not reach the $ N billion or more implicit in the imf 's request for a doubling of its $ N billion capital the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase
 this would be consistent with its <unk> support for the brady plan and <unk> exchange-rate intervention and with its financial commitment to mexico poland and others
 the imf has several reasons for <unk> the increase
 its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the 1970s
 the size and pace of <unk> will accelerate further under the brady plan which promises larger and earlier <unk> to approved countries
 at least three other factors have encouraged the imf to insist on increased capital
 first it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets for which it feels some responsibility
 second the world bank 's recent $ N billion capital increase $ N billion from the u.s. has left the imf feeling less than first <unk> among international financial institutions
 third the imf would like to meet japan 's request for increased ownership currently N N
 japan has supported a larger role for the imf in developing-country debt issues and is an important financial resource for <unk> programs in developing countries
 while international politics may argue for the capital increase there is a clear economic case against it
 opponents of the increase argue that the imf practices central planning while supporting <unk> governments
 they question whether the imf has any role in developing countries given its original mandate to assist industrial countries in <unk> <unk>
 opponents show that there are already more funds available than <unk> reform efforts
 they worry that new imf funding of developing countries will simply end up <unk> imf debt for <unk> commercial bank debt a bad trade all around
 they believe <unk> which addresses the problems of markets investment climate and management practices is the key to developing-country growth not the imf 's <unk> focus on trade deficits quarterly targets and government debt
 they point at the numerous developing-country governments that have inflated taxed and regulated themselves into <unk> under <unk> imf programs
 decisions on increases in the imf 's capital base traditionally are made by the administration with subsequent authorization by congress
 the last u.s. congressional authorization in N was a political <unk> and carried a $ N billion housing program along with it to secure adequate votes
 the politics of the N congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous <unk>
 liberals may support the stabilizing <unk> role of the imf on two conditions that the administration give assurances that liberal democrats ' support will not be used against them in congressional re-election campaigns and that the legislation address with dollars social and environmental concerns
 conservative republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party 's popular president in an election year
 a u.s. decision to refuse the imf its capital increase or limit it to N N would bring a major change in international economic policy and could not be taken <unk>
 <unk> would <unk> over the implications for the <unk> coordination process and the stability of world financial markets
 because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase a <unk> imf mission would leave both feeling <unk>
 furthermore a u.s. rejection of the capital increase and transfer of shares to japan would give japan an argument against future calls for economic <unk>
 on the other hand a decision to increase the imf 's capital would reinforce the central economic role of <unk> institutions in developing countries
 with the increase even more developing-country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning ministries that generate <unk> economic plans
 <unk> the <unk> could slow economic development even further as countries delay <unk> steps in anticipation of richer <unk> support
 conservatives should take a position prior to the administration 's year-end deadline
 the issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase rather than its purpose
 if conservatives do n't support an increase in the imf 's capital then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative

 in a move that could pose a new competitive challenge to time warner inc. 's powerful home box office cable giant tele-communications inc. agreed to buy half of showtime networks inc. from viacom inc. for $ N million
 the purchase comes after nearly three years of <unk> <unk> talks between tci and viacom which has also discussed the sale of an interest in showtime with other cable operators
 showtime is a distant no. N to home box office and in may filed a $ N billion antitrust suit against time warner charging the company and its hbo and american television cable units with conspiring to <unk> the pay tv business
 hbo has close to N million subscribers to its hbo and <unk> networks while showtime and its sister service the movie channel have only about N million according to paul <unk> associates a <unk> calif. research firm
 for tci the investment in showtime puts it in an unusual position as the largest cable operator with control of close to N million of the nation 's N million cable subscribers tci is hbo 's largest customer
 but tci president john <unk> has long been concerned about hbo 's dominance of the pay tv business and has been eager to keep showtime as a healthy competitor
 it is important to the cable industry that we have a <unk> and competitive <unk> marketplace mr. <unk> said in a statement
 in a telephone interview robert thomson tci senior vice president said showtime 's suit against hbo does n't involve us and nothing we 're doing here bears any relationship to that
 he added we do n't intend to be drawn into it noting that tci wo n't play any active role in the management of showtime
 linking up showtime with the largest cable operator in the u.s. could sharply boost its subscribers
 tci said it may bring in other cable operators as investors a practice it has employed in the past with investments in other cable networks such as the discovery channel
 additional cable partners could boost subscribers even further
 time warner declined comment
 in addition to owning hbo time warner owns american television & communications inc. the nation 's second largest cable operator after tci
 viacom also owns cable systems but it is the <unk> largest operator of such systems with less than one million subscribers
 the tci investment is a big victory for viacom 's chief executive officer frank <unk> and <unk> h. cox president of the showtime unit
 this takes any question of showtime 's viability and puts it away once and for all mr. <unk> said in a telephone interview
 the fight between hbo and showtime is particularly <unk> because mr. <unk> is the former chief executive of hbo and mr. cox served as chief of marketing for the service
 they were both hired by <unk> <unk> the boston billionaire who took control of viacom three years ago in a leveraged buy-out
