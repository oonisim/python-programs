# Matrix
## Row Order
Always row order matrx. NEVER mix up with column order matrix.

## dot
Use np.matmul() or np.inner(), instead of np.dot(), to be specific with your intentions. np.dot() is not clear if your intention is matrix multiplication or dot product.


# Naming Convention

### Plural 

If it is **size** or **volume**, be clear with it.

#### Number of features of data ```x``` 

* NG: features
* OK: num_features


Use **features** for actual features e.g **age**, **weight**, **height** of a person.
