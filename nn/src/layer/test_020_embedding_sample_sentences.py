Mr Biden said at the White House on Monday: 'In two months let's celebrate independence as a nation and our independence from this virus. We can do this. We will do this.
The Democratic president also announced a new website, vaccines.gov, that Americans can use to more easily find vaccination sites after widespread complaints that the sign-up process was too difficult for some.
The president told reporters: 'We're also going to slip vaccines directly to paediatricians, ship them to paediatricians, during the following weeks so parents and their children can talk to their family doctor about it and get the shot from the provider they trust the most. Easy, fast and free.
According to the research released on Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics, children in states that count Covid cases by age now make up around 22.4% of all new infections. That's up significantly from 3% of new daily cases at this point last year, found the study.
Mr Biden also said he was speaking to US businesses to announce shopping discounts for vaccinated Americans.
We're working with major sports leagues to launch special promotions for their fans. Things like ticket giveaways, in-stadium vaccinations, discounts on merchandise and other creative ways to make it easier and more fun to get vaccinated,' he said.
